# K2Spy

K2Spy was intended as an alternative to K2s own SmartObject Tester tool. Besides allowing SmartObjects to be tested, it also allows check-in/check-out management, uploading raw XML to K2, viewing the underlying XML definitions, searching the definitions and analyzing them.

I don't have time to complete the project and the source in its current state is therefore now open source
