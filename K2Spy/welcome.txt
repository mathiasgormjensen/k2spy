Welcome to K2Spy!

K2Spy allow K2s internal XML definitions to be viewed, searched and analyzed.
Furthermore K2Spy includes other features such as (but not limited to):
- Ability to directly upload forms, views and workflows
- Ability to perform XPath-search across all XML definitions
- Ability to extract categories and the contained definitions (forms, views, workflows)
- Check in/check out management
- Execution of SmartObject
- Listing invalid SmartObjects

K2Spy relies heavily on just-in-time caching meaning performance will improve over time.
If you want to preload the cache, you can do so via the Options-dialog.

K2Spy has been developed by Mathias Gorm Jensen (mathias.jensen@pomio.dk) and is intended as an alternative to K2s own SmartObject Service Tester-tool.
